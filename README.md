# Ansible+Kubernetes+ELK+ML

## Background

In order to analyse, process, learn as well as predict out of the astronomical data we require the capability to deploy various models. Sometimes, these models are required to be developed at local or preproduction machines as well as later deployed to production environment. Model used in certain project may not necessarily be fit for the next one. Therefore, an automated deployment project is necessity for this purpose and for various needs of different organisation.

Please refer to the wiki for details design and implementation descriptions.
